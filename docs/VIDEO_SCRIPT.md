## [0:00-0:20] Opening & Problem Statement (20 seconds)

**[Visual: Split screen showing frustrated developer debugging code]**

**Narrator:**

"Developers spend 35 to 50 percent of their time debugging and reviewing code. That's nearly half your day stuck finding bugs instead of building features. What if an AI agent could do this for you in seconds?"

**[Text overlay: "35-50% time on debugging" → "What if AI could help?"]**

## [0:20-0:50] Solution & Why Agents (30 seconds)

**[Visual: Animated agent system diagram]**

**Narrator:**

"Introducing the Code Review and Debug Agent—a multi-agent AI system that acts like a senior developer reviewing your code 24/7.

Why agents? Because debugging isn't one task—it's many. Our system uses specialized agents working together:
- A CodeReviewAgent that spots issues
- A DebugAgent that finds root causes  
- A FixerAgent that generates corrections

They collaborate in intelligent workflows, learning from every review."

**[Animation: Show agents passing work sequentially: Review → Debug → Fix]**

## [0:50-1:30] Architecture (40 seconds)

**[Visual: Architecture diagram with highlighting]**

**Narrator:**

"Here's how it works. When you submit code:

1. The Multi-Agent Orchestrator routes your request
2. The CodeReviewAgent analyzes quality using GPT-4 or Gemini
3. Custom tools scan for security vulnerabilities and complexity
4. If issues are found, the DebugAgent diagnoses root causes
5. The system generates fixes and tracks everything in memory
6. All operations are traced and optimized for token efficiency

The system learns from each review, building a knowledge base of common bugs and fix strategies."

**[Highlight each component as mentioned]**

## [1:30-2:15] Demo (45 seconds)

**[Visual: Screen recording of enhanced_example.py running]**

**Narrator:**

"Let's see it in action. Here's code with a common bug—division by zero.

[Run sequential workflow demo]

Watch as the system:
- Reviews the code and finds 3 issues
- Identifies the critical bug on line 5
- Generates a fixed version with error handling
- All in under 30 seconds

[Show loop workflow]

The loop workflow iteratively improves code quality, running multiple review-fix cycles until it meets your standards.

[Show tools demo]

Built-in tools catch security issues like hardcoded passwords and unsafe eval calls."

**[Screen shows actual output with metrics]**

## [2:15-2:45] The Build & Technology (30 seconds)

**[Visual: Code snippets and logos]**

**Narrator:**

"Built using cutting-edge technology:
- OpenAI GPT-4 and Google Gemini for intelligence
- Multi-agent orchestration with LangChain
- Custom tools for syntax, complexity, and security analysis
- Session management for conversation memory
- Distributed tracing for observability
- Context engineering to optimize token usage

The system implements 5 advanced concepts from the course—exceeding the 3 requirement—including multi-agent workflows, custom tools, memory systems, observability, and context optimization."

**[Show code snippets transitioning quickly]**

## [2:45-3:00] Impact & Call to Action (15 seconds)

**[Visual: Results dashboard with metrics]**

**Narrator:**

"The result? Reviews in 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes. Catch 85% of bugs before production. Save your team 60-70% of review time.

Try it yourself—the code is open source. Link in description.

Stop debugging. Start building."
